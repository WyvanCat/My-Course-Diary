<h1>My Course Diary</h1>

<font face="Helvetica"><b>30/8-2021</b>

<br><br>
This is the very first course week. It has been very interesting so far! 
I had a moment of confusion as I started the course in the wrong order, beginning
by watching the GIT and GITHub videos. I had to ask a lot of questions to people 
around, trying to make sense of it, but now it all fell into place! 
I'm very excited about the things we are about to learn. I think it will be very fun.

I have so many questions still, but I'm sure they will be answered soon! 
All my options were just greyed out but it turned out it's because I'm in the middle of a debug.
